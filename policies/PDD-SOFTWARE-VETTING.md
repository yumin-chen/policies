# Software Technology Vetting Policy

## Purpose

*This document establishes a policy for vetting new software technologies and vendors to mitigate risks associated with vendor lock-in and technology monopolies.*

## Principles

*To maintain technological independence, foster innovation, and ensure the long-term viability of our technology stack.*

## Enforcement Mechanisms

*All new software and technology acquisitions must undergo a formal vetting process, including a review by the System Architecture Council. A written report outlining the risks and benefits must be submitted for approval.*

## Governance

*The System Architecture Council is the decision-making authority for this PDD. Exceptions to this policy require a formal resolution from the council.*

## Rationale

*To avoid situations where the organization becomes overly dependent on a single vendor or technology, which can lead to increased costs, reduced flexibility, and stifled innovation.*
